                MMA is my hobby and passion, I enjoy every aspect of the arts, it is very important to me.
                <br>
                Mixed martial arts is many different sports put into one, on this website I will try to show you a closer look into few of them.
                <br>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts">Here is some information from wikipedia!</a>
                <br>
                <br>

                Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a full-contact combat sport that allows both striking and grappling,
                both standing and on the ground, using techniques from other combat sports and martial arts.
                The first documented use of the term mixed martial arts was in a review of UFC 1 by television critic Howard Rosenberg in 1993.
                The term gained popularity when newfullcontact.com, then one of the largest websites covering the sport,
                hosted and republished the article. The question of who actually coined the term is subject to debate.
                <br>
                <br>
                During the early 20th century, various mixed-style contests took place throughout Japan and the Pacific Rim.
                In 1980 CV Productions, Inc., created the first regulated MMA league in the United States, named Tough Guy Contest,
                later renamed Battle of the Superfighters. The company sanctioned ten tournaments in Pennsylvania.
                However, in 1983 the Pennsylvania State Senate passed a bill prohibiting the sport.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 1993, the Gracie family brought vale tudo,
                developed in Brazil from the 1920s, to the United States by founding the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)
                MMA promotion company.
                <br>
                <br>
                Originally promoted as a competition to find the most effective martial arts for real unarmed combat,
                competitors from different fighting styles were pitted against one another in contests with relatively few rules.
                Later, individual fighters employed multiple martial arts into their style.
                MMA promoters were pressured to adopt additional rules to increase competitors' safety,
                to comply with sport regulations and to broaden mainstream acceptance of the sport.
                Following these changes, the sport has seen increased popularity with a pay-per-view business
                that rivals boxing and professional wrestling. ~ from wikipedia

                <br>
                Boxing is a combat sport in which two people wearing protective gloves
                throw punches at each other for a predetermined set of time in a boxing ring.
                <br>
                <br>
                Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a common fixture in most international
                games—it also has its own World Championships. Boxing is supervised by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute
                intervals called rounds. The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee, is disqualified
                for breaking a rule, resigns by throwing in a towel, or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges' scorecards at the
                end of the contest. In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, the fight is considered a draw (professional boxing).
                In Olympic boxing, due to the fact that a winner must be declared, in the case of a draw - the judges use technical criteria to choose the
                most deserving winner of the bout.
                <br>
                <br>
                While people have fought in hand-to-hand combat since before the dawn of history,
                the origin of boxing as an organized sport may be its acceptance by the ancient Greeks as an Olympic game in BC 688.
                Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th
                century, again initially in Great Britain and later in the United States.

                BJJ is one of my favourite disciplines, it involves a lot of skill and does not allow you to rely only on brute strength.

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu">Here is some information from wikipedia about Brazilian Jiu Jitsu!</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Brazilian jiu-jitsu (/dʒuːˈdʒɪtsuː/; Portuguese: [ˈʒiw ˈʒitsu], [ˈʒu ˈʒitsu], [dʒiˈu dʒiˈtsu]) (BJJ; Portuguese: jiu-jitsu brasileiro)
                is a martial art, combat sport system that focuses on grappling and especially ground fighting. Brazilian jiu-jitsu was formed from Kodokan
                judo ground fighting (newaza) fundamentals that were taught by a number of individuals including Takeo Yano, Mitsuyo Maeda and Soshihiro Satake. Brazilian jiu-jitsu eventually came to be its own art through the experiments, practices, and adaptation of judo through Carlos and Helio Gracie (who passed their knowledge on to their extended family) as well as other instructors who were students of Maeda, such as Luiz Franca.[2]
                <br>
                <br>
                BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger,
                stronger, heavier assailant by using proper technique, leverage, and most notably, taking the fight to the ground,
                and then applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the opponent. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments
                and in self-defense situations.[3] Sparring (commonly referred to as rolling) and live drilling play a major role in training,
                and a premium is placed on performance, especially in competition, in relation to progress and ascension through its ranking system.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since its inception in 1882, its parent art of judo was separated from older systems of Japanese jujutsu
                by an important difference that was passed on to Brazilian jiu-jitsu: it is not solely a martial art, but it is also a
                sport; a method for promoting physical fitness and building character in young people; and, ultimately, a way (Do) of life.[4][5]~ from wikipedia

                Muay Thai (Thai: มวยไทย, rtgs: Muai Thai, pronounced [mūa̯j tʰāj] ( listen)) is a combat sport of Thailand that uses stand-up striking along with various clinching techniques.[1][2][3][4] This physical and mental discipline which includes combat on shins is known as "the art of eight limbs" because it is characterized by the combined use of fists, elbows, knees, shins, being associated with a good physical preparation that makes a full-contact fighter very efficient.[5] Muay Thai became widespread internationally in the twentieth century, when practitioners defeated notable practitioners of other martial arts. The professional league is governed by The Professional Boxing Association of Thailand (P.A.T) sanctioned by The Sport Authority of Thailand (S.A.T.), and World Muaythai Federation (WMF) overseas.

                Karate (空手?) (English /kəˈrɑːtiː/; Japanese pronunciation: [kaɽate] ( listen); Okinawan pronunciation: IPA: [kaɽati]) is a martial art developed in the Ryukyu Kingdom. It developed from the indigenous martial arts of Ryukyu Islands (called te (手?), "hand"; tii in Okinawan) under the influence of Chinese martial arts, particularly Fujian White Crane.[1][2] Karate is now predominantly a striking art using punching, kicking, knee strikes, elbow strikes and open-hand techniques such as knife-hands, spear-hands, and palm-heel strikes. Historically, and in some modern styles, grappling, throws, joint locks, restraints, and vital-point strikes are also taught.[3] A karate practitioner is called a karateka (空手家?).
                <br>
                <br>
                Karate developed on the Ryukyu Islands in what is now Okinawa, Japan. It was brought to the Japanese mainland in the early 20th century during a time of cultural exchanges between the Japanese and the Chinese. It was systematically taught in Japan after the Taishō era.[4] In 1922 the Japanese Ministry of Education invited Gichin Funakoshi to Tokyo to give a karate demonstration. In 1924 Keio University established the first university karate club in mainland Japan and by 1932, major Japanese universities had karate clubs.[5] In this era of escalating Japanese militarism,[6] the name was changed from 唐手 ("Chinese hand" or "Tang hand")[7] to 空手 ("empty hand") – both of which are pronounced karate – to indicate that the Japanese wished to develop the combat form in Japanese style.[8] After World War II, Okinawa became an important United States military site and karate became popular among servicemen stationed there.[9]
                <br>
                <br>
                The martial arts movies of the 1960s and 1970s served to greatly increase the popularity of martial arts around the world, and in English the word karate began to be used in a generic way to refer to all striking-based Oriental martial arts.[10] Karate schools began appearing across the world, catering to those with casual interest as well as those seeking a deeper study of the art.
                <br>
                <br>
                Shigeru Egami, Chief Instructor of Shotokan Dojo, opined that "the majority of followers of karate in overseas countries pursue karate only for its fighting techniques ... Movies and television ... depict karate as a mysterious way of fighting capable of causing death or injury with a single blow ... the mass media present a pseudo art far from the real thing."[11] Shōshin Nagamine said, "Karate may be considered as the conflict within oneself or as a life-long marathon which can be won only through self-discipline, hard training and one's own creative efforts."[12]
                <br>
                <br>
                On September 28, 2015, karate was featured on a shortlist along with baseball, softball, skateboarding, surfing, and sport climbing to be considered for inclusion in the 2020 Summer Olympics. On June 1, 2016, the International Olympic Committee's executive board announced they were supporting the inclusion of all five sports (counting baseball and softball as only one sport) for inclusion in the 2020 Games.
                <br>
                <br>
                Web Japan (sponsored by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs) claims there are 50 million karate practitioners worldwide,[13] while the World Karate Federation claims there are 100 million practitioners around the world.[14]

                Judo (柔道 jūdō?, meaning "gentle way") was created as a physical, mental and moral pedagogy in Japan, in 1882, by Jigoro Kano (嘉納治五郎). It is generally categorized as a modern martial art which later evolved into a combat and Olympic sport. Its most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the objective is to either throw or takedown an opponent to the ground, immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a pin, or force an opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke. Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defenses are a part of judo, but only in pre-arranged forms (kata, 形) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice (randori, 乱取り). A judo practitioner is called a judoka.

                The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from koryū (古流?, traditional schools). The worldwide spread of judo has led to the development of a number of offshoots such as Sambo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

                Wrestling is a combat sport involving grappling type techniques such as clinch fighting, throws and takedowns, joint locks, pins and other grappling holds. The sport can either be theatrical for entertainment, or genuinely competitive. A wrestling bout is a physical competition, between two (occasionally more) competitors or sparring partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior position. There are a wide range of styles with varying rules with both traditional historic and modern styles. Wrestling techniques have been incorporated into other martial arts as well as military hand-to-hand combat systems.

                The term wrestling is attested in late Old English, as wræstlunge (glossing palestram).[1]
